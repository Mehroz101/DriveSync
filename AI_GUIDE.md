You are a Senior SaaS Product Architect, Principal Software Engineer, DevOps Lead, and Growth Strategist combined.

Your task is to deeply analyze my entire codebase and repository structure.

Your objective is to generate a FULL PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION FILE in MARKDOWN (.md) format that explains what I am building, its business value, its technical architecture, growth roadmap, and scalability strategy.

PHASE 2 — CORE PRODUCT EXPANSION  
PHASE 3 — MONETIZATION  
PHASE 4 — ENTERPRISE SCALE  
PHASE 5 — AI AUTOMATION  

For each phase include:

- Feature name
- Why it should be built

- Stripe integration readiness
- Investor readiness

============================
SECTION 12 — FINAL EXECUTION CHECKLIST
============================

Create:

============================
OUTPUT RULES
============================

- Output must be professional Markdown
- Use headings, tables, bullet points
- Be extremely detailed
- Reference actual files when possible
- Be practical and execution-oriented
- Think like a SaaS founder building a billion-dollar product
- Do not generalize — give real-world implementation advice
- Assume production scale from day one

Start now by scanning the repository and generating the documentation.
